# V2 Go Kitchen Sink

Go Kitchen Sink
===============

A **kitchen sink** repository for Go, demonstrating various implementations and use cases of Go programming concepts. This project covers a wide array of features and utilities for Go developers, including AWS SDK integrations and Go language features.

Features
--------

*   **AWS SDK for Go**: Examples of interacting with AWS services like S3 and EC2.
*   **Algorithm Implementations**: Sorting algorithms, prime number checks, and more.
*   **Data Structures**: Demonstrates usage of slices, arrays, maps, and other data structures in Go.
*   **Utility Functions**: Reusable utility functions for string manipulation, file handling, and more.
*   **Go Testing**: Unit test examples using Go's testing package.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

*   Go 1.18+ installed
*   AWS SDK for Go
*   (Optional) [LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/) for simulating AWS services locally

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phakhruddin/gokitchensink.git
cd gokitchensink
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Running Examples

To run specific examples, you can use the following commands:

```bash
go run s3_list_bucket.go
```

This command will demonstrate listing S3 buckets using the AWS SDK.

### AWS Integrations

The repository includes examples for interacting with AWS services. To run them, ensure you have AWS credentials configured. Examples include:

*   **S3 Bucket Listing** (`s3_list_bucket.go`)
*   **Security Group Descriptions** (using EC2 API)
